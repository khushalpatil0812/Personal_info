# 📸 ADD YOUR PROFILE PICTURE - SIMPLE STEPS

## Current Status: 
Your portfolio shows "KP" initials because there's no real photo yet.

## How to Add Your Photo (3 Easy Steps):

### Step 1: Download/Save Your Photo
- Use the professional photo you showed me (the one in a suit)
- Or use any professional headshot you prefer

### Step 2: Prepare the Photo
- **Rename it to**: `profile.jpg` (must be exactly this name)
- **Recommended**: Square image (same width and height)
- **Size**: At least 400x400 pixels
- **Format**: JPG or PNG (but name it profile.jpg)

### Step 3: Replace the File
1. Open File Explorer
2. Go to: `d:\perosnal_project\public\`
3. You'll see a file named `profile.jpg`
4. **Delete it** or replace it with your actual photo
5. Make sure the new file is named exactly: `profile.jpg`

### Step 4: See the Result
1. Go back to your browser (http://localhost:5174/)
2. Press **Ctrl + Shift + R** (hard refresh)
3. Your photo will appear!

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting:

**If you still see "KP" after adding the photo:**

1. **Check the file name**: Must be `profile.jpg` (lowercase, no spaces)
2. **Check the location**: Must be in `d:\perosnal_project\public\` folder
3. **Hard refresh browser**: Ctrl + Shift + R (not just Ctrl + R)
4. **Check file type**: Right-click → Properties → Type should be "JPG File" or "PNG File"
5. **Restart dev server**: 
   - In terminal, press `Ctrl + C` to stop
   - Run `npm run dev` again
   - Refresh browser

## ✅ What Will Change:

**Before (current):**
- Blue circle with white "KP" initials

**After (with your photo):**
- Your actual professional photo
