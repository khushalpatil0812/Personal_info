# 🖼️ IMPORTANT: Add Your Profile Picture

## Your profile picture is NOT showing because it's a placeholder file!

### Quick Fix (2 minutes):

1. **Find your professional photo** (the one you showed me earlier - the one in the suit)

2. **Save it with this EXACT name**: `profile.jpg`

3. **Replace the file at this location**:
   ```
   d:\perosnal_project\public\profile.jpg
   ```

4. **Refresh your browser** (Press Ctrl + R or F5)

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. Right-click on your photo → Save As
2. Navigate to: `d:\perosnal_project\public\`
3. Name it: `profile.jpg` (lowercase, .jpg extension)
4. When asked "Replace file?", click **YES**
5. Go back to your browser and refresh (Ctrl + R)

### ✅ Your photo will immediately appear in the About section!
